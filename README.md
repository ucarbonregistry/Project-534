The project activity involves supply, erection, commissioning
and operation of 32 machines of rated capacity 800 kW & 600kW each. The machines are Enercon E48, E-40 & E-53 make. The project is owned by SUN N SAND HOTELS PVT LTD (hereinafter referred to as the Project Proponent or PP).

SUN N SAND HOTELS PVT LTD has installed 25.2 MW wind farm in the state of Maharashtra &
Rajasthan in India. There are 32 Wind Energy Convertors (“WEC’s”) of with rated capacity 800 kW &
600kW each. The generated electricity is supplied to Electricity Distribution Company (DISCOM)
under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). The expected operational lifetime of the project is
for 20 years. The project being a renewable energy generation activity, leads to reduction in fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation from the Indian grid.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity
from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and supply
38,852 MWh of electricity annually to the Indian grid. The project thus addresses the demand–supply
gap in the state of Maharashtra & Rajasthan and will assist the sustainable growth, conservation of
resources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy source like wind
energy. The project activity will contribute towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from
the atmosphere, which has been estimated to be approximately 28,587 tCO2e per year, by displacing an
equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid
comprising mainly of fossil fuel-based power plants. Thus, the project does not only reduce the
demand-supply gap of the respective grid, but also helps in reducing other pollutants like SOx, NOx,
etc. from the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated from the connected/ new power plants in the Indian grid, which are/ will be
predominantly based on fossil fuels.
